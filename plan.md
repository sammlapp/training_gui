This project will create a cross-platform desktop app that runs pytorch machine learning models and allows users to train models in an active learning loop. 

## minimal changes:
allow up to N background tasks to run in parallel if user clicks run in parallel


# Build and release
- lightweight python executable for GUI back-end is built with pyinstaller
- heavy python environment is built with conda-pack (inference, train scripts)
- inference, train, extraction scripts run in separate processes and are tracked by task manager
- these run with the built-in heavier conda env (downloaded on demand to application cache dir) unless the user specifies a custom python env to use
- an annotation-only version of the app can be built

# Incomplete items / TODO /feature request

## known bugs

backend lightweight_server does not terminate on app termination

cannot ctrl/cmd+c/v in the app 

When using remote file explorer, "save" dialogue is incorrect - cannot create file

Review tab: 
When the layout number of columns/rows is changed, the active clip changes. Instead, the page should update so that the previously active clip is still on the displayed page, and is still the active clip. 
Sometimes the review tab does not render specs on the page (bin) when enabling or changing settings of classifier guided listening (CGL). They only render on page change. We should ensure that any clips displayed in the current page/bin get rendered immediately 


Need to test training (failed, fixed bug in script, didn't try again)

Extraction load config is not working

Extraction results in an error, somewhere we get a pd.Series instead of pd.DataFrame

## next steps:
server configuration and connection; test remote access; fix file save (create file) dialog

- CGL true/false should persist across app restart

lightweight_server backend not properly terminating when app terminates. Add a parent process listener in lightweight_server.py that will terminate the lightweight_server if the parent process disappears. Make sure the parent process ID is passed to lightweight_server regardless of how it is launched. 

Save view + CGL settings in config file alongside annotation csv. Load settings from config file if found when opening the annotation csv

test inference with custom/local models

test builds that allow inference and training

get feedback on inference and training builds

add alternative "view mode" for multi-class annotation: instead of a multi-select box, each class has a button that can be toggled for present/absent. Class buttons are floated in a wrapping div, such that multiple can appear side by side if there is enough horizontal space and vertical space is added to the clip panel if needed to display all options. 

- PyInstaller build is likely overly complicated: I think we should be able to use other modules without the "sys.path.append" workarounds to find the modules. 

- Review saving/loading annotation settings to json: includes view settings and CGL


- stratification by arbitrary columns in metadata for clip extraction

- delete archive file of pytorch env after unpacking

- download the correct pytorch .tar.gz conda-pack env based on the operating system

Review tab status bar: if we are in the full app (not review-only), the review status bar is covered by the global app status bar, it should be bumped up so that it is not hidden. 

separate HopLite Database-oriented embed, train, and predict into its own app

## general feature request list 

get xeno-canto / other public recordings for a species to supplement training data?!
- this functionality is now provided in Jan's package
- also possible via scripting on BirdSet, though snapshot is early 2024

denoising and/or bandpassing for audio playback / review

wandb integration with training & inference for logging progress and model evaluation: login on global settings page, specify user/project/run name/notes in configuration panel; if used, provide link to wandb page in task panels

for clip review from query/explore mode: "add to cart" button on panel, adds the clip to an annotation "cart" that can be exported as an annotation task


review tab "undo" functionality? I think this would require tracking the full-page or single-clip annotations in a history so that we can sequentially undo and redo changes witch ctrl/cmd+z and ctrl/cmd+y


## Extraction improvements:
Stratification by folder metadata (eg 'primary period', 'secondary period','site', 'treatment group')

#### For stratify by folder metadata:
user selects a csv file with `folder` column and other columns
form populates with multi-select of the other columns
user selects which other columns to use for stratification
form displays the number of unique values for each selected stratification column


#### For stratify by date window: 
display a panel with a table of MUI date range pickers. Starts with no rows.
Provide 'delete' buttons for each added row, and an 'add' button below the table to add a new date range. 
Example of DateRangePicker from MUI:
```
import * as React from 'react';
import { DemoContainer } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/internals/demo';
import { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers-pro/LocalizationProvider';
import { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers-pro/AdapterDayjs';
import { DateRangePicker } from '@mui/x-date-pickers-pro/DateRangePicker';

export default function BasicDateRangePicker() {
  return (
    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>
      <DemoContainer components={['DateRangePicker']}>
        <DateRangePicker />
      </DemoContainer>
    </LocalizationProvider>
  );
}
```

- "status bar" is being covered by the global app status bar in App.js instead of integrating with it. 
- auto-advance in classifier-guided listening mode: 

Something is wrong with the way grid mode is rendering when CGL is enabled. When CGL is off, I can create a grid with 2 columns, but when CGL is on, choosing 2 columns setting creates only 1 column in the displayed grid. 

### ✅ Review-only App
within this project, create a separate deployable/buildable version of the app that only includes the Review tab. In this version of the app, we can remove page navigation as there will only be one page. We should be able to build this app as a desktop executable that includes the lightweight compiled python environment.

- the offset of main content vs top menu bar isn't working correctly. When the window is narrow the menu bar will wrap around and become larger, causing it to cover the top of the main content. The main content should simply always be below the menu bar. It seems like there should be a simpler way to do this than trying to calculate the expected height of the menu bar, by placing the element below the menu bar instead of behind it. 

## rewind
- throughout the application, when providing click-to-play spectrograms, make it so that clicking on the left 20% of the spectrogram rewinds the clip to the beginning instead of performing the play/pause action. Show a rewind icon when hovering over the left 20% of the spectrogram. 

## Remote mode
- install on a remote machine accessed via SSH
- replace native filesystem / other native system interactions with text fields or other working alternatives
- avoid system alerts/dialogues, which won't work
- add Global Settings page with option to switch between remote and desktop versions
- provide instructions for port forwarding to access the gui on a web browser
- launch from CLI with argument for HTTP forwarding port
- Streamlit has some nice backend support for multiple users using the same hosted app, but ours will not. Think carefully about what would happen if multiple users used the app on a multi-user machine. This gets quite a bit more complicated. Probably want to launch a separate instance of the app for each user/session and prevent multiple users from using the same session. 
- would be huge if task management can be integrated across users; eg what if two people run the app on the same server, should have a central task management system and run jobs sequentially

alternatively, could run backend on remote, run frontend locally, connect to backend via GUI on frontend. This seems more complicated overall because it requires more custom IPC.

### Training wishlist
- convert Raven annotations to training data
- create single-target labels from subfolder structure (wrote this in a python notebook)
- Weldy style noise augmentation (wrote this in a python notebook)
- preprocessing "wizard": started notebook for prototype

## embedding: 
add toggle in inference script to embed instead or in addition to classification

## HOPLITE embedding and shallow classification 
Separate app for hoplite embedding workflow
(eventually add Query also)

I have implemented functionalities for "embed audio to database" (mode='embed_to_hoplite') and "apply shallow classifier" (mode="classify_from_hoplite") modes in the inference.py script. We need to expose these functionalities to the user on the front end. Embed tab: similar form to Inference tab, runs inference.py with mode='embed_to_hoplite'. 
- instead of Save sparse outputs and Separate inference by subfolders fields, shows multi-select for database selection: 
- Create New Hoplite Database (user selects parent folder and enters name of new db in a text field)
- Add embeddings to existing Hoplite Database (user selects an existing folder; system confirms that "hoplite.sqlite" file exists in the folder)
-  User selects the embedding model from BMZ or local file path
- form has controls for batch size, num workers, and optionally specifying a custom python environment
- embedding script should write a dipper config file into the database folder, specifying the model and settings used for creating the embedding database

Predict tab: user selects an existing hoplite database (a folder) and an existing shallow classifier (from file). Besides this there are just some configuration options (borrow from Inference tab) for batch size, activation layer, save sparse outputs, separate by subfolder, and test run on a few clips. Runs inference.py with mode="clasify_from_hoplite" in config. 

Train tab: I need to write backend script
User selects hoplite database (folder) and annotation files. Same configuration settings/form as training in full app for selecting train/val sets with single and multi-target labels
- loads the dipper config file from the embedding database folder
- embeds any training/val sets as necessary

Review tab: same as review tab for full app. 

Query tab: I need to write backend script that embeds the query clips and runs search across db


## conda-pack updates:
- if on linux or mac, include ai-edge-litert as a dependency and allow BirdNET use in the inference gui
inference issue: BirdSet model not producing outputs if clips are <5 seconds

## inference tab updates:
- app should download the appropriate env for inference if needed. tell user its downloading and will be saved for future use
- checkbox for 'Separate inference by subfolders'

### add process ID tracking to reconnect with running process across app close/restart
The running task continues when the app quits.

  Here's what happens:

  1. Inference subprocess keeps running - The python inference.py process started
  by lightweight_server.py runs independently
  2. Server shuts down - The HTTP server stops, losing connection to the subprocess
  3. Task status becomes orphaned - On restart, the task gets reset to QUEUED
  status (we just fixed this)
  4. Results still get saved - The inference completes and saves output files
  normally

  Issue: No way to reconnect to the orphaned process or get its results back into
  the task system.

  Potential improvements:
  - Add process ID tracking to reconnect on restart


## Annotation task creation panel Improvements:
- Review tab binary classification: check box in settings to show f"Score : {row['score']:0.2f}" in the clip display panel (just below audio file display position)

## inference tab updates:
for completed tasks, add a button to create an annotation task

Too many subfolders in job folder: after creating job folder for inference/train with unique name, should be flat file structure with config.json, logs, and any outputs such as inference predictions.csv or saved model objects. 

Add a button for each task in the task manager to "load config" -> loads that task's config to the configuration form, switching to train/inference tab as appropriate. 


for completed tasks, add buttons to
- open results in Explore tab
- create annotation task (we need to implement a wizard/panel for this)
Inference:
- subset classes: can use text file or ebird filter

Inference update:
- optional sparse outputs: don't save scores below a floor, and save df as a sparse pickle
I've implemented this in inference.py using config['sparse_save_threshold']. Update the frontend inference config creator to:
- toggle on/off an option to save only values below a threshold. If off, config['sparse_save_threshold'] is none/null
- if toggled on, user specifies the numeric threshold for the logit score beneath which scores are discarded, default value -3. config['sparse_save_threshold']
- output_file of the config should be predictions.csv if sparse_save_threshold is None and sparse_predictions.pkl if the threshold is used


- explore tab should support loading sparse predictions (.pkl) as well as csv files (.csv). This will require using python backend to run `sparse_df_loaded = pd.read_pickle("sparse_df.pkl")`. the sparse values are np.nan and should always be treated as non-detections. The unpickled df will be a dataframe with the multi-index 'file','start_time','end_time'.

TODO:
- allow setting threshold when loading an annotation task in Review mode

# Explore tab updates
- should have a little button in the panel (gold medal icon: 🥇)  to the right of the title, to return to viewing the highest-scoring clip (eg after clicking on a histogram bin)
- put the display settings in a side panel/tray, like the settings panel in the review tab. Make sure the settings are properly implemented and are not mixed up with the display settings for the review tab. 
- images are being cut off at the bottom. Resize them to the height of the 

future items:
- use Material UI badges and small photos of the class detected for quick overview (use birdnames repo for name translation, find open-source set of images for species headshots or use the global bird svgs dataset)


when selecting models in inference or training mode, we should be able to select a local model file instead of
