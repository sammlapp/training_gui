            ## Dipper Full App Release

            This release includes platform-specific installers with full ML training capabilities.

            ### Installation

            **macOS:**
            1. Download `*.dmg` for your architecture (x64 for Intel, arm64 for Apple Silicon)
            2. Open the DMG and drag Dipper to Applications
            3. The ML environment will be automatically downloaded on first use

            **Windows:**
            1. Download `*.exe` installer
            2. Run the installer
            3. The ML environment will be automatically downloaded on first use

            **Linux:**
            1. Download `*.AppImage`
            2. Make the AppImage executable: `chmod +x *.AppImage`
            3. Run the AppImage
            4. The ML environment will be automatically downloaded on first use

            ### ML Environment

            The conda-pack ML environment (~700MB) is built separately and will be downloaded automatically by the app when needed.
            You can also manually download pre-built environments from the [conda environment releases](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/training_gui/releases?q=conda-env).

            ### What's New
