Properties
classes: 'Classes[Self]'

The classes of the element.

The client this element belongs to.

html_id: 'str'

The ID of the element in the HTML DOM.

Added in version 2.16.0

Methods
add_dynamic_resource(name: str, function: Callable) -> None

Add a dynamic resource to the element which returns the result of a function.

param name:	name of the resource
param function:	function that returns the resource response
add_resource(path: str | Path) -> None

Add a resource to the element.

param path:	path to the resource (e.g. folder with CSS and JavaScript files)
add_slot(name: str, template: str | None = None) -> Slot

Add a slot to the element.

NiceGUI is using the slot concept from Vue: Elements can have multiple slots, each possibly with a number of children. Most elements only have one slot, e.g. a ui.card (QCard) only has a default slot. But more complex elements like ui.table (QTable) can have more slots like "header", "body" and so on. If you nest NiceGUI elements via with ui.row(): ... you place new elements inside of the row's default slot. But if you use with table.add_slot(...): ..., you enter a different slot.

The slot stack helps NiceGUI to keep track of which slot is currently used for new elements. The parent field holds a reference to its element. Whenever an element is entered via a with expression, its default slot is automatically entered as well.

param name:	name of the slot
param template:	Vue template of the slot
return:	the slot
ancestors(include_self: bool = False) -> Iterator[Element]

Iterate over the ancestors of the element.

Bind the source of this element to the target object's target_name property.

The binding works both ways, from this element to the target and from the target to this element. The update happens immediately and whenever a value changes. The backward binding takes precedence for the initial synchronization.

param target_object:
 	The object to bind to.
param target_name:
 	The name of the property to bind to.
param forward:	A function to apply to the value before applying it to the target (default: identity).
param backward:	A function to apply to the value before applying it to this element (default: identity).
param strict:	Whether to check (and raise) if the target object has the specified property (default: None, performs a check if the object is not a dictionary, added in version 3.0.0).

clear() -> None

Remove all child elements.

default_classes(add: str | None = None, remove: str | None = None, toggle: str | None = None, replace: str | None = None) -> type[Self]

Apply, remove, toggle, or replace default HTML classes.

This allows modifying the look of the element or its layout using Tailwind or Quasar classes.

Removing or replacing classes can be helpful if predefined classes are not desired. All elements of this class will share these HTML classes. These must be defined before element instantiation.

param add:	whitespace-delimited string of classes
param remove:	whitespace-delimited string of classes to remove from the element
param toggle:	whitespace-delimited string of classes to toggle (added in version 2.7.0)
param replace:	whitespace-delimited string of classes to use instead of existing ones
default_props(add: str | None = None, remove: str | None = None) -> type[Self]

Add or remove default props.

This allows modifying the look of the element or its layout using Quasar props. Since props are simply applied as HTML attributes, they can be used with any HTML element. All elements of this class will share these props. These must be defined before element instantiation.

Boolean properties are assumed True if no value is specified.

param add:	whitespace-delimited list of either boolean values or key=value pair to add
param remove:	whitespace-delimited list of property keys to remove
default_style(add: str | None = None, remove: str | None = None, replace: str | None = None) -> type[Self]

Apply, remove, or replace default CSS definitions.

Removing or replacing styles can be helpful if the predefined style is not desired. All elements of this class will share these CSS definitions. These must be defined before element instantiation.

param add:	semicolon-separated list of styles to add to the element
param remove:	semicolon-separated list of styles to remove from the element
param replace:	semicolon-separated list of styles to use instead of existing ones
delete() -> None

Delete the element and all its children.

descendants(include_self: bool = False) -> Iterator[Element]

Iterate over the descendants of the element.

param include_self:
 	whether to include the element itself in the iteration
get_computed_prop(prop_name: str, timeout: float = 1) -> AwaitableResponse

Return a computed property.

This function should be awaited so that the computed property is properly returned.

param prop_name:
 	name of the computed prop
param timeout:	maximum time to wait for a response (default: 1 second)
mark(*markers: str) -> Self

Replace markers of the element.

Markers are used to identify elements for querying with ElementFilter which is heavily used in testing but can also be used to reduce the number of global variables or passing around dependencies.

param markers:	list of strings or single string with whitespace-delimited markers; replaces existing markers
move(target_container: Element | None = None, target_index: int = -1, target_slot: str | None = None) -> None

Move the element to another container.

param target_container:
 	container to move the element to (default: the parent container)
param target_index:
 	index within the target slot (default: append to the end)
param target_slot:
 	slot within the target container (default: default slot)
on(type: str, handler: events.Handler[events.GenericEventArguments] | None = None, args: None | Sequence[str] | Sequence[Sequence[str] | None] = None, throttle: float = 0.0, leading_events: bool = True, trailing_events: bool = True, js_handler: str = '(...args) => emit(...args)') -> Self

Subscribe to an event.

The event handler can be a Python function, a JavaScript function or a combination of both:

If you want to handle the event on the server with all (serializable) event arguments, use a Python handler.
If you want to handle the event on the client side without emitting anything to the server, use js_handler with a JavaScript function handling the event.
If you want to handle the event on the server with a subset or transformed version of the event arguments, use js_handler with a JavaScript function emitting the transformed arguments using emit(), and use a Python handler to handle these arguments on the server side. The js_handler can also decide to selectively emit arguments to the server, in which case the Python handler will not always be called.
Note that the arguments throttle, leading_events, and trailing_events are only relevant when emitting events to the server.

Updated in version 2.18.0: Both handlers can be specified at the same time.

param type:	name of the event (e.g. "click", "mousedown", or "update:model-value")
param handler:	callback that is called upon occurrence of the event
param args:	arguments included in the event message sent to the event handler (default: None meaning all)
param throttle:	minimum time (in seconds) between event occurrences (default: 0.0)
param leading_events:
 	whether to trigger the event handler immediately upon the first event occurrence (default: True)
param trailing_events:
 	whether to trigger the event handler after the last event occurrence (default: True)
param js_handler:
 	JavaScript function that is handling the event on the client (default: "(...args) => emit(...args)")
pause() -> None

Pause audio.

param name:	name of the method
param args:	arguments to pass to the method
param timeout:	maximum time to wait for a response (default: 1 second)
seek(seconds: float) -> None

Seek to a specific position in the audio.

param seconds:	the position in seconds
